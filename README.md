# Admission-Process-Analysis-and-Prediction

<b>Dataset</b>
This dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.
The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.The parameters included are :
GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 )
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university.

<b>Graphical Analysis using Tableau</b>
The presentation contains a detailed presentation of the project. It also contains graphical analysis of the dataset and its interpretations.

<b>Hypothesis Test</b>
We assume that LOR (Letter of Recommendation) and SOP (Statement of Purpose) strength has equal significance and impact on the chances of admission.

<b>Prediction</b>
In the ChanceOfAdmission excel file we have used Bayes' theorem to predict the accuracy of our chance of admission predictions.
